# EduContacts User Guide

<br> 

EduContacts is a **desktop app for Educators in Tertiary Institution to manage contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. For educators who may be less experienced with command-based tools, EduContacts also includes user-friendly and intuitive features and guidance, making it accessible for all users.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your EduContacts.

1. To run EduContacts, open a command terminal.

   To navigate to the folder where you placed the `.jar` file, use the `cd` command. For example, if you placed the file in a folder named `EduContacts` on your Desktop, you would enter:

   ```bash

   ```
   
   and use the following command to run the application:

   ```bash

   ```bash 
   add 12345678 n/John Doe p/99999999 e/johndoe@example.com a/123 Jane Doe Road c/Computer Science t/Student
   ``` 
   Adds a contact named `John Doe` to EduContacts.
   
   ```bash 
   delete 12345678
   ```
   Deletes a student contact with StudentID `12345678`.

   ```bash

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.


* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Warning:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, EduContacts will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the EduContacts to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: I am unfamiliar with command-line interfaces. How should I begin using EduContacts?<br>
**A**: We recommend starting with the **Quick Start** section of the user guide, which provides essential steps for setup and installation. Once you have the application running, utilize the `help` command or Help button to view a comprehensive list of available commands and their functions. Additionally, the **Features** section offers detailed instructions and examples for each command. We recommend familiarizing yourself with these resources as it will enhance your experience with EduContacts.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduContacts home folder.

**Q**: Is there a way to recover accidentally deleted contacts?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, once deleted, a contact cannot be recovered unless you have a backup of the JSON file from before deletion. Regular backups are recommended for this reason.

**Q**: Can I export my contacts to Excel or another format?<br>
**A**: EduContacts data is stored in JSON format. You can convert JSON files to Excel or CSV using an external tool or script to make data compatible with spreadsheet applications.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
